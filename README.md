### 👋 Hi, I’m @broccoli-cake

🔍 I’m passionate about **understanding complex systems structurally** and designing secure, scalable, and automated infrastructures.  
💡 I believe infrastructure and security should be designed **together**, not as afterthoughts — especially in cloud-native environments.
